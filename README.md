## Overview

**Abstract:** In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking, a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance synergistic information through an Infinite Masking strategy. InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks.

## Training and Evaluation

### Installation 

Please create a conda environment with python 3.8 and install the required packagesÂ after the code is cloned.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate multimodal
cd InfMasking
```

###  Synthetic Experiments on Trifeature Datasets

To run the synthetic experiments on Trifeature datasets, please execute the following command:

```bash
bash run_scripts/trifeatures_run.sh
```

To evaluate the learned representations, please execute the following command. Please change the dataset and specific-dataset parameters in `run_scripts/test.sh` before running the command.

```bash
bash run_scripts/test.sh
```
The evaluation of below models is supported in `run_scripts/test.sh`.

#### Results

We select "Cross", "Cross+Self", FactorCL, MAE and CoMM as baselines for comparison.
